            <p>
            I was born and raised in Jiangxi Province, China. Inspired by the creativity of the nature, I dedicated my life to seeking the harmony between design and humanity.
            I like colors because they remind me of the view when I was on top of Mountain Jinggangshan with the flow of the strips of the wind and the floating clouds that refracts lights into speechless colors.
            I like UI design because it's the result of understanding, consideration and efficiency, which I learn the most from the nature. 
            California gave me the similar harmonious feeling: One hour driving to the Atlantic beaches, one hour driving to the Rocky mountains; live cities like San Francisco and San Jose, National Parks like Yosemite. All these feature the harmony of Cali life.

                        A few weeks ago I joined fellow Creative Director and boyfriend Andrew at an AIGA event featuring several prominent designers, the theme of which was “Day in the Life: SF x NY.” I haven’t been to many design events lately since I’m too tired to have any more friends, and do most of my “keeping current on the industry” research on Feedly during lunch and bathroom breaks. However this event intrigued us, as we’re always halfway wondering if we should be in California, especially... </p>

                        2015 was a humbling year for me. In September of 2014, I joined a tiny but established startup called SproutVideo as their third employee and first designer. The role interests me because it affords the opportunity to see how design can grow a solid product with a loyal user-base into something even better. The work I do now could also have a real impact on the brand and user experience of our product for years to come, which is a thrilling prospect in an industry where much of what I do feels... </p>

                        I open my eyes and Buffalo Bill Cody, or Cody, as we call him, is wagging his tail wildly in the bed next to mine. My dad sits next to him, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and I shyly wave at him, but he doesn’t wave back. I lean forward and wave bigger, insistent that he acknowledge that I am awake too. He mirrors the gesture and whispers “what time is it?” My phone is scrounged from its home under the pillow. “3:30.” Cody jumps from bed and licks my face, and I jump from bed too,... </p>

                        It’s been about two months since I returned to freelance after two years of working with Chartbeat, and these last two months have been, well, hard. I’ve done full-time freelance before, but it wasn’t nearly this much of a struggle. Back then I was 25, and I didn’t care very much about building a long term sustainable business. I was mostly motivated by working in sweatpants, and telling myself I was so liberated because I didn’t have a “real job,” and hey no one can tie ME down!... </p>
