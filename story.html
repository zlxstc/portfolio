					“Love is the burning point of life, and since all life is sorrowful, so is love. The stronger the love, the more the pain. Love itself is pain, you might say — the pain of being truly alive.” Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth When I was 16 my English class read Joseph Cambpell’s The Power of Myth as part of our study of the Hero’s Journey. It was one of the most memorable moments in my education; I felt the curtain had been pulled back on culture, literature, religion,...				</p>

					A few weeks ago I joined fellow Creative Director and boyfriend Andrew at an AIGA event featuring several prominent designers, the theme of which was “Day in the Life: SF x NY.” I haven’t been to many design events lately since I’m too tired to have any more friends, and do most of my “keeping current on the industry” research on Feedly during lunch and bathroom breaks. However this event intrigued us, as we’re always halfway wondering if we should be in California, especially...				</p>

					“When I was a boy … my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” – Mr. Rogers About 2 months ago I got an email from Drew Schwartz, VP of Product at a company called Hometeam, asking if I wanted to learn more about the company and the Creative Director role they were looking to hire. Sometimes I send a canned response to recruiting emails, usually I don’t respond at all. But this wasn’t a recruiting email, it was a short...				</p>

					2015 was a humbling year for me. In September of 2014, I joined a tiny but established startup called SproutVideo as their third employee and first designer. The role interests me because it affords the opportunity to see how design can grow a solid product with a loyal user-base into something even better. The work I do now could also have a real impact on the brand and user experience of our product for years to come, which is a thrilling prospect in an industry where much of what I do feels...				</p>

					I open my eyes and Buffalo Bill Cody, or Cody, as we call him, is wagging his tail wildly in the bed next to mine. My dad sits next to him, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and I shyly wave at him, but he doesn’t wave back. I lean forward and wave bigger, insistent that he acknowledge that I am awake too. He mirrors the gesture and whispers “what time is it?” My phone is scrounged from its home under the pillow. “3:30.” Cody jumps from bed and licks my face, and I jump from bed too,...				</p>

					It’s been about two months since I returned to freelance after two years of working with Chartbeat, and these last two months have been, well, hard. I’ve done full-time freelance before, but it wasn’t nearly this much of a struggle. Back then I was 25, and I didn’t care very much about building a long term sustainable business. I was mostly motivated by working in sweatpants, and telling myself I was so liberated because I didn’t have a “real job,” and hey no one can tie ME down!...				</p>
